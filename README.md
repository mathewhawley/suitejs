## Installing / Getting started

First up, clone the repository and change in to the root directory.

Make sure you are running [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8.*. If you use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), you can simply run:

```
$ nvm use
```

If [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8.* isn't available, run:

```
$ nvm install
```

This will download, install and switch to the latest [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8.*.

Next, install the dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Finally, 'bootstrap' the packages <sup>[[1]](#foot-note)</sup>:

```
$ lerna bootstrap
$ lerna run validate
```

And that's pretty much it! The bootstrap/validate steps should have gone without a hitch :crossed_fingers:.

<sup>[1]</sup> The `validate` script is used in place of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)'s `prepublish` life-cycle hook, called when using `lerna bootstrap`. It is used to prep the packages for release. It runs the following tasks:

* `clean`
* `lint`
* `test`
* `build:*`

We don't use `prepublish`, `prepare`, or `prepublishOnly` life-cycle hooks as these [behave](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/16685) [differently](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/15147) across different versions of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (and are also poorly documented).

Unfortunately, at the time of writing, there doesn't appear to be a life-cycle hook where we can perform these tasks ONLY prior to packing and publishing (with backwards compatibility), that won't be run by consumers of the package.
